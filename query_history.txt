A: Becoming a Digital Master involves adopting certain strategies that vary by industry and company circumstances. Companies can take different paths based on their initial position in terms of digital capabilities.

1. **Path from Fashionista to Digital Master**:

A: To track improvements in IT-business relationships over time, one might consider metrics such as the alignment between digital initiatives and strategic objectives. High-level metrics could include monitoring progress through a Digital Transformation Index, which assesses how business units are advancing towards transformation goals. Granular metrics may involve specific process-driven performance measures like online credit-card application-to-issue time, demonstrating efficiency improvements in IT-enabled processes.

Additionally, measuring the impact of experimental digital activities, such as an online ad campaign on social media platforms, can provide insights into how well IT initiatives support business objectives. By connecting these various levels of measurement—both top-down and initiative-specific—a coherent understanding emerges, facilitating improved alignment between IT efforts and broader business goals. This iterative review process helps refine strategies continuously to ensure sustained progress in the IT-business relationship.

2025-07-08 14:52:43.172060 - Q: Does IT Steering Committee ever mentioned as one of the vehicle to improve relationship between IT and the Business?
A: The concept of steering committees is discussed in relation to improving coordination and alignment across various units within a company. These committees, comprised of senior executives, focus on policy ratification, resource allocation, and prioritizing projects that align with the company's digital vision. Although not specifically mentioned as an "IT Steering Committee," their role in governance can naturally extend to bridging gaps between IT functions and business objectives by ensuring both entities are aligned in strategy and execution. This function includes addressing concerns from different departments such as engineering, manufacturing, or customer-facing roles, which implies that they could facilitate better relationships between IT and the broader business context by aligning technological initiatives with business goals.

In a practical example given, a steering committee helps coordinate efforts across units to launch a connected-cars concept. This kind of coordination likely involves significant IT-business interaction, suggesting that steering committees play an indirect role in enhancing these relationships by promoting integrated decision-making processes and ensuring both sides are aligned on priorities and policies. Additionally, they can champion investments that business units might not prioritize independently, such as developing global customer platforms, further indicating their potential to strengthen IT-business ties through strategic investment and policy alignment.
